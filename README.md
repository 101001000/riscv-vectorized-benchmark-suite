# RISC-V Vectorized Bencmark Suite

## Overview

The RISC-V Vectorized Benchmark Suite is a collection composed of seven data-parallel applications from different domains. The suite focuses on benchmarking vector microarchitectures; nevertheless, it can be used as well for Multimedia SIMD microarchitectures. Current implementation is targeting RISC-V Architectures; however, it can be easily ported to any Vector/SIMD ISA thanks to a wrapper library which we developed to map vector intrinsics and math functions to the target architecture.

The benchmark suite with all its applications and input sets is available as open source free of charge. Some of the benchmark programs have their own licensing terms which might limit their use in some cases.

The implementation is based on the Working draft of the proposed RISC-V V vector extension v0.7.1

## Building Vectorized Applications 

The RISC-V Vectorized Bencmark Suite has been successfully tested on Ubuntu 18 and Centos7

### Setting up the environment

The Suite includes a makefile to compile every application, in order to use it, you must define the path to the RISC-V vector compiler.

Setting the Vector Compiler path
```
export LLVM=$TOP/epi-toolchain
export PATH=$PATH:$LLVM/bin
```

### Compile using  clang for RISCV Vector Version

We provide precompiled binaries found in the folder bin.

To compile any application you first enter in the subfolder and run the command make followed by the application name
```
cd _application
make application 
```
For example to compile blackscholes:
```
cd _blackscholes
make blackscholes 
```
The same for the other applications ...

Also you can compile all the applications by typing:
```
make all 
```

### Running applications

There are provided 5 different simulation sizes (arguments to run the application). Assuming that the application is running on a simulator, is recommended to not use "native" simulation size.
```
simtiny : takes seconds to be executed on gem5
simsmall : takes around 15 minutes to be executed on gem5
simmedium : takes around 1  hour to be executed on gem5
simlarge : takes around 8 hours to be executed on gem5
native : only for native hardware
```

Whe you are executing an application, you must write the following arguments to run a predefined simsize.
#### simtiny

canneal_args        = "1 100 300 input/100.nets 8"
